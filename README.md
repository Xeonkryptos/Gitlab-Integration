<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin is designed to work directly with Gitlab without leaving the IDE itself. You are able to list the available repositories (at the moment, only yours) and clone them as easy as possible
onto your own computer.

Planned features:

* Switch between tree representation and list representation of your projects
* Create new gitlab projects from within the IDE
